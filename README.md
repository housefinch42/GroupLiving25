#Description: In this paper we investigated how group-living impacted fitness-related behaviours, foraging and anti-predator responses, in a gregarious songbird. Data for all analyses were taken from four behavioural assays, two assessing foraging behaviours and two assessing anti-predator responses. All bird’s group-living treatment (single-housed or group-housed) and disease status (diseased or healthy) were the predictor variables analysed.

#Files/Folders in Dataset and Description of Files 
 #[d7ttc.csv] – A .csv file containing data from a behavioral experiment where house finches (either group-housed or single-housed and either infected or sham control) were captured from their cage by a human during early infection.
#[d15ttc.csv] – A .csv file containing data from a behavioral experiment where house finches (either group-housed or single-housed and either infected or sham control) were captured from their cage by a human during early infection. 
#[TimetoCap.R] – An RStudio file containing all analyses for latency to capture behavioural assay

#[Feeder_Behavior_22.csv] – A .csv file containing data for a house finch’s responses to a novel and normal feeder type based on disease status (diseased or healthy) and group-living treatment (single-housed or group-housed).
#[survfeed.csv] – A .csv file containing data for a house finch’s latency to approach either a novel or a normal feeder type based on disease status (diseased or healthy) and group-living treatment (single-housed or group-housed.)
#[Feeder.R] – An RStudio file containing all analyses for foraging behavioural assays. 

#[Pred_Behav.csv] – A .csv file containing data for a house finch’s responses to an overhead predator mount flyover, as well as their behaviours during the 30 minute period post-mock predator flyover. 
#[survpred.csv] – A .csv file containing data for a house finch’s latency to respond to a mock predator flyover based on disease status (diseased or healthy) and group-living treatment (single-housed or group-housed)
#[Predator.R] – An RStudio file containing all analyses for mock predator flyover behavioural assays. This includes analyses of time spent immobile during the assay and the latency to respond to the mock predator flyover. 

#[eye_score_all.csv] – A .csv file containing data for house finch disease severity (severity of conjunctivitis) based on group-living treatment. 
#[path_load_all.csv] – A .csv file containing data for house finch pathogen load based on group-living treatment. 
#[eye_score_path.R] – An RStudio file containing all analyses for disease severity and pathogen load.
